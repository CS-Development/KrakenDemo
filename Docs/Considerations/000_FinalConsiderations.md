# Final Considerations

What went good:

- creating an architecture that mixed several concepts together
  - Clean architecture principles
  - Mvvm + Input/Output
  - Redux unidirectional flow
  - Combine FRP Paradigm
  - Swift UI declarative paradigm and state management

What went wrong:

- a little bit of fighting between: 
  - trying to adher as much as possible to the clean architecture principles
  - use the SwiftUI state management property wrappers 



The proposed solution must be intended as a show off of multiple knowledges and techniques used to implement mobile applications. 

It doesn’t mean to be a proposal of the best solution. 

With some years of experience working for different companies and with different teams, I learned that there is not such a thing called „Best solution“. There are several alternatives solutions and they are all relatively good. 

The best solution is the „greatest solution“ of the team, that takes in consideration multiple factors

- What is best for the company
- What is best for the team
- What is easy for the team and good for the management goals
- What follows a common standard established by the team itself
