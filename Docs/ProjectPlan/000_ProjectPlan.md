# Project Plan

A simple Kanban project has been created on the Project's GitHub site:

https://github.com/CS-Development/KrakenDemo/projects/1

A few of macro Tasks were created there just to give an idea of the process.


More tasks could be defined in order to improve/evolve the project:

- Extend and complete Project Documentation
- Improve the Architecture Design
- Define the Modules and split the codebase in modules/packeges
- Write User Stories and Behavior Specifications
- Improve and extend the writing of Unit Tests
- Write Integration Tests and Acceptance Tests
- Design CI/CD processes
